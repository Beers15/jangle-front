## Conflict Plan

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**\
Determine how much we care about certain things (scale of 1 to 5), the person with a lower score should be potentially be willing to concede to the person to whom it matters more. Give each party the floor for a short uninterrupted period of time to state their case. We will let democracy prevail.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**\
If someone has concerns with another individual, bring it up with them in a 1-on-1 setting and not with the entire group. Be mindful, ask questions, be empathetic.

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**\
Regular check-ins and communication. If something is unclear for you, ask for help. If someone asks a group member for clarification, there is an expectation that the other member(s) will teach them.

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**\
If someone has concerns with another individual, bring it up with them in a 1-on-1 setting and not with the entire group. Be mindful, ask questions, be empathetic. It is expected that all members will contribute and be given help by the other members in doing so.

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**\
Maintain professionalism. If concerns aren't addressed in 1-on-1 scenario, discuss with other teammates. If this fails to solve the conflict, said concerns will be elevated to management.

**What platforms will you use to communicate?**\
Discord and Remo will primarily be used. Phone communication will be used if needed.

**How often will you take breaks?**\
Breaks will be taken as needed. Team members will communicate when they need one. Team members are encouraged to let the team know if they need to take an extended break.

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**\
The team will review the end goal and Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Priorities will be associated with non-MVP tasks and lower priority tasks will be eliminated if necessary.

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**\
Via one of the platforms mentioned above. Discord will be the primary option for weekend communication.

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**\
After a team member speaks, it is expected that they will ask the other group what they think. Open discussion will be encouraged.

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**\
Decent behavior will be expected. Hostile behavior will not be tolerated.

## Work Plan

**How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**\
We'll be using GitHub's issues tracker to create and track tasks pertaining to our application. This feature is tied into the GitHub projects feature.

**What project management tool will be used?**\
GitHub's Projects Tool will be used for this.

---

## Git Process

**What components of your project will live on GitHub?**\
Everything except private or personal information. All relevant code and configuration files appropriate for the application.

**How will you share the repository with your teammates?**\
Via the Jangle Git Organization - all members are Owners/Admins. We will push up on individual branches as needed, then will merge to staging.

**What is your Git flow?**\
Members will start the day by pulling down the codebase. Everyone will stay in communication to ensure they're not duplicating efforts or causing merge conflicts.

**Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:**

- **How many people must review a PR?**\
    Two reviews for main branch. All PRs must be committed on individual feature branches. No review required to merge with staging branch.

- **Who merges PRs?**\
    Whoever feels most confident in someone else's code should do this. If no member is confident, they will leave a comment in the pull request to ask for another of set of eyes on the involved code.

- **How often will you merge?**\
    Members will merge into staging when a feature is complete. Code will be merged into main when staging is at a working state, and when it makes sense to do so. An example would be when the group adds new feature(s) into staging.

- **How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?**\
    A lot of the team's communication for a specific pull request or issue should be communicated in those respective areas on Github. This way the communication persists and anyone can go back and reference it. The team will also communicate with each other via chat if not all members are in the voice chat during a given merge.
